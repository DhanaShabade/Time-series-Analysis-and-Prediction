# Time-series-Analysis-and-Prediction
In this project, I have utilized my expertise in Time Series Analysis to analyze and forecast power generation data. This involved implementing and evaluating three of the most popular time series models: Single Exponential, Exponential Smoothing, and Holt Winter Model. By analyzing historical power generation data, I have been able to forecast future power generation levels and identify trends and patterns in the data. The project has involved data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to determine the most accurate and reliable forecasting model. The insights gained from this project can be used to optimize power generation strategies, ensure efficient use of resources, and provide valuable insights for businesses and organizations operating in the energy sector.
